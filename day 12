Question:-

Given a positive integer k and an array arr[] denoting heights of towers, you have to modify the height of each tower either by increasing or decreasing them by k only once.
Find out what could be the possible minimum difference of the height of shortest and longest towers after you have modified each tower.


Solution:-

class Solution {
    public int getMinDiff(int k, int[] arr) {
        // code here
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int n = arr.length-1;
        int res = arr[n] - arr[0];
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++) {
            
            int min = Math.min(arr[0]+k , arr[i]-k);
            int max = Math.max(arr[n]-k , arr[i-1]+k);
            
            res = Math.min(res , max-min);
        }
    return res;
    }
}
