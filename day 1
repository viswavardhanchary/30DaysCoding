Question:-
Given an array arr[][] such that arr[i][0] is the starting time of ith meeting and arr[i][1] is the ending time of ith meeting, the task is to check if it is possible for a person to 
attend all the meetings such that he can attend only one meeting at a particular time.
Note: A person can attend a meeting if its starting time is greater than or equal to the previous meeting's ending time.


Solution:-
class Solution {
    static boolean canAttend(int[][] arr) {
        // Your code here
        Arrays.sort(arr , new Comparator<int[]>() {
            public int compare(int[] a , int [] b) {
                return a[1] - b[1];
            }
        });
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length-1;i++) {
            if(arr[i][1] > arr[i+1][0]) return false;
            if(arr[i][0] > arr[i][1]) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
