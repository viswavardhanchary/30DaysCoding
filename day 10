Question:-

The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get.
Note: A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously and multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day


Solution:-
  
  int maximumProfit(int prices[], int n) {
    // code here
    int start = prices[0];
    int end = prices[0];
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i=1;i<n;i++) {
        if(prices[i] < prices[i-1]) {
            sum += (end - start);
            start= prices[i];
            end = prices[i];
        }else {
            end = prices[i];
        }
    }
    sum += (end - start);
    return sum;
}
